Swerve Drive: (hyprlink)
a type of drive configuration where each wheel is controlled by 2 motors:
one that controls its angular position and one that controls
its forward velcity. 

Mecanum Drive:
a type of drive configuration where each wheel is made up of smaller, angled
wheels. Placed so that the angled wheels make a sort of chevron pattern 
(REWORD THIS), the turning of the wheels allow for greater motion freedom.
effectively the precursor to swerve

Tank Drive:
Also known as Differential drive, this is a drive configuration in which 
there are only 2 independent sets of wheel movement, and so turning
is controlled by differences in velocity of either side. This configuration
is the least agile, but has in years past proven useful is defensive manouvres
due to its grippy wheels.
