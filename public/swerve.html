          <h3>The Swerve Module Object</h3>
          each individual wheel is controlled by 2 motors: one that controls velocity 
          and another that controls the wheel's rotation. in order to collect enough 
          information on our wheel rotation, we also had an external encoder for our 
          angular motor that collected odometry information. so each swerve module takes 
          the arguments:

          <!--TODO: check arguments-->
          <ul>
            <li>velocity motor ID</li>
            <li>angular motor ID</li>
            <li>encoder ID for the angular motor</li>
          </ul>

          <!--TODO: elaborate-->
          This folder also includes the PID configuration for the angular motor.

          <!--TODO: check that method names are code accurate, 
                    check that this is all the methods-->
          some other helpful methods included in the file:
          <ul>
            <li>get SwerveModuleVelocity:
              <br>&emsp;returns the current velocity of module</li>
            <li>get SwerveModulePosition:
              <br>&emsp;returns the current angular position of module
              <br><u>Note:</u> we needed to do some trig here to get our encoder input
                    into useable radian output </li>
            <li>reset encoders</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3>The Swerve Subsystem</h3> 
        </p> 
        
        <!--TODO: make sure this section matches names in code-->
        <p>
          in this file, we instantiate each of our 4 swerve modules and write 
          important methods that can be called later. the most relevant method 
          is our drive method, which takes an xPercent, yPercent, rotationPercent, 
          and (optionally) a field relative boolean as arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          xPercent and yPercent are joystick X and Y input (more on joystick control 
          later) fed through a trapezoidal motion profile (AKA slew rate limiter)- 
          which creates a smoother acceleration- and then multiplied by the maximum 
          velocity, which is later passed to our motors as the speed.

          rotationPercent is the rotational equivalent: joystick input fed through 
          a trapazoidal profile limiting the angular acceleration, multiplied by our 
          maximum angular velocity.
        </p>

        <p>
          the field relative boolean changes the frame of reference, which can 
          make driving easier. robot relative controls might define 'forward' as 
          being towards the direction of front of the robot, while field relative 
          mode may be towards the direction that the driver is facing. 
        </p>

        <!--TODO: check for excluded methods-->
        <p>Other useful methods include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>getVelocity:
              <br>&emsp;calculates the velocity of one of the velocity motors fed 
              through a linear/gaussian filter</li>
          <li>getRotation:
              <br>&emsp;returns rotation minus any detected offset (our gyro had a 
              method for this)</li>
          <li>zeroYaw:
              <br>&emsp;zeroes detected offset</li>
          <li>hasHitSomething:
              <br>&emsp;detected sharp drops in velocity, and was useful for autonomous 
              functions</li>
        </ul>

        <!--TODO: fix this paragraph -->
        <p>
          the rest of the file was dedicated towards collecting continuous updates 
          from the motor controllers and joysticks, which (forgive me for any 
          improper terminology useage) would probably equate to reading the twist 
          messages
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3>The Drive Command</h3>
        </p>

        <p>
          we took 3 main input values: the flightstick being pushed in the x 
          direction, the y direction, and how the flightstick was being twisted. 
          these were passed as the xPercent, yPercent, and rotationPercent arguments in our drive method from the swerve subsystem. 
        </p>

        <p>
          for additional fine-tuning, we added a small deadband to our inputs to 
          prevent unwanted movement, and instead of passing joystick input directly 
          into our drive method, we multiplied them by a certain amount less than 1 
          to make the change in velocity less sensitive to large movements. 
          additionally, we changed these values when holding down the trigger to 
          simulate a 'fast mode' when traversing great distances.
        </p>

        <p>
          finally, we had a toggle for field oriented drive and another for yaw 
          zeroing, but as this file was for keybindings, really any method we 
          found useful could be bound to any key here.
